Sample PHP Unit Testing Cases
=============================

We will provide some simple PHP unit test cases here to demostrate how 
to use phpunit to do unit testing.

We assume that buildout has been executed successfully.

    $ bin/phpunit src/sandbox/tests/SimpleTest.php

Run Test Suites in phpunit.xml
------------------------------

    $ bin/phpunit src/sandbox/tests
